    "    Qualitative analysis of annotator comments in irresolvable cases reveals two primary themes: (1) disagreement about the directness of supporting evidence needed to assign a responsibility and (2) disagreement about which responsibility a piece of evidence indicates.  These themes align with two significant dimensions of ambiguity identified by Chen et al.: (a) data ambiguity, meaning multiple reasonable interpretations, often due to missing or unclear context, and (b) human subjectivity, meaning distinct interpretations resulting from ''different levels of understanding or sets of experiences'' among annotators \\cite{chen_using_2018}.  Chen et al. further utilize disagreement between coders as a proxy for ambiguity, and the lower IRR scores relative to the phases indicates a higher degree of ambiguity.  Could the primary dimension of ambiguity leading to low IRR scores be human subjectivity?  Because the annotators are the same for both phases and responsibilities, it is unlikely.\n",
    "Is data ambiguity excacerbated by soft boundaries in the codebook?  The irresolvable cases suggest that it could, and that further attempts to clarify the boundaries between responsibilities and the types of evidence that constitute a responsibility could decrease ambiguity and improve IRR.  However, expert feedback indicates that our operationalization is reasonable.  These points of evidence suggest an inherent ambiguity to the classification task.  Only real option is to choose a different classification task! (I think that's what I believe, sadly...)\n",

    "These qualitative observations align with conceptualizations of ambiguity by Chen et al... and the low IRR indicates this!\n",
